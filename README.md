# Xlity v2 — Goofy Account Copier

My own goofy little version of "guns/.lol" — now upgraded to **v2** with way more features and copy buttons! 🎉  
Nothing serious, just a random fun project to experiment and mess around.

## ✨ About
This project is purely for fun and learning.  
It’s **not meant for real use** — just a silly way to play with web effects, account buttons, and rainbow text animations.  

v2 adds:  
- Multiple accounts like **Roblox, Steam, Discord, Epic Games, Minecraft, etc.**  
- Rainbow-animated text for all buttons  
- Click-to-copy functionality for each account  
- Fun hover animations  
- Easy to expand for more accounts in the future
